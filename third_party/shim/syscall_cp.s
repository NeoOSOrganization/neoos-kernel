// NeoOS's replacement for musl's src/thread/x86_64/syscall_cp.s.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: upstream's version issues `syscall` DIRECTLY
// with Linux's number in %rax, which walks straight past the shim in
// syscall_arch.h. Every cancellable call -- read, write, open, close,
// readv, writev, nanosleep, wait4 -- goes through here, so with the
// upstream file a musl program could exit (exit_group is not a
// cancellation point, so it took the C path and was translated) but
// could not print a single byte. That is exactly how it presented: a
// process that ran to completion, returned 0, and produced no output.
//
// So the cancel check stays, and the syscall itself is handed to
// __neoos_syscall like every other one.
//
// DIVERGENCE: __cp_begin/__cp_end no longer bracket the `syscall`
// instruction itself -- it now lives inside __neoos_syscall -- so the
// "was the thread interrupted inside a cancellable syscall" test that
// pthread cancellation depends on is no longer exact. Nothing uses
// musl's pthreads on NeoOS yet. When something does, this is the file
// that has to be revisited.
