// NeoOS's replacement for musl's src/process/x86_64/vfork.s.
//
// vfork pops its return address before the syscall and pushes it
// after, so it cannot go through the funnel either. NeoOS's fork is
// 12; Linux's is 58.
//
// DIVERGENCE: this is a real fork, not a vfork -- NeoOS has no vfork,
// and fork is the safe direction to diverge in (vfork's contract is a
// subset). Recorded in docs/stdlib.md.
