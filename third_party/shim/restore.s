// NeoOS's replacement for musl's src/signal/x86_64/restore.s.
//
// This one translates the NUMBER INLINE rather than calling
// __neoos_syscall, and that is deliberate: a signal restorer runs on a
// stack the kernel laid out, and sigreturn finds the saved context at
// a fixed offset from %rsp. Calling into the funnel would push a
// return address and a stack argument first, moving %rsp and hiding
// the frame the kernel is about to restore from.
//
// So the rule the rest of the shim follows -- one place that knows
// both numbering schemes -- is bent here for the two files that cannot
// disturb the stack. NeoOS's rt_sigreturn is 23; Linux's is 15.
